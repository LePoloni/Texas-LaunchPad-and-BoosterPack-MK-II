# Texas-LaunchPad-and-BoosterPack-MK-II
Basic project for use of LaunchPad TM4C123 and BoosterPack MK II

These files make it possible to use the Texas LaunchPad TM4C123 shield, BoosterPack MK II and MicroSD Card.
The BSP library was created by Professor Valvano and his son. It has been changed to become better.
The MKII library implements spectral functions in MK II using TivaWare HAL.
The sdcard library was created by Javier Mart√≠nez Arrieta. It has been fixed to be used in the LaunchPad.
